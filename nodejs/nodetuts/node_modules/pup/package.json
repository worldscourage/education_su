  "readme": "# Pipe and Unpipe streams\n\n## Overview\n\nAs of node 0.8.x, there is no way to unpipe streams. This module attemps to fill the gap by providing a `pipe(source, destination[, options])` and `unpipe(source, destination)` functions working in tandem, to do piping and unpiping of streams.\n\n## Usage\n\nInstall with\n\n    npm install pup\n\nTwo functions are provided:\n\n* `pipe(source, destination[, options])` : to be used to setup a pipe from source to destination. Same signature as the Stream#pipe method.\n* `unpipe(source, destination)` : remove the pipe between source and destination. If there are many of those, only the first one is removed. Return `true` on successful removal, `false` otherwise.\n\n\n## Example\n\n``` javascript\nvar fs = require('fs')\nvar pup = require('pup')\n\nvar source = fs.readFileStream('test')\nvar wrong_destination = fs.readWriteStream('test2')\nvar destination = fs.readWriteStream('test.bak')\n\n// Pipe to one destination\nsource.pause()\npup.pipe(source, wrong_destination)\n\n// Then remove it and pipe to another\npup.unpipe(source, wrong_destination)\npup.pipe(source, destination)\n\n// Copy the file test.js, which should only end up in test.bak\nsource.resume()\n```\n\n## Restrictions\n\nThis is a bit of a hack that relies on the assumption that there is the same `cleanup()` listener setup by the Stream#pipe method for the `end` event on the source and on the destination.\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT",
